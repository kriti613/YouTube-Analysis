# YouTube Comments and Metrics Analysis

## Overview
In this digital era, YouTube has emerged as a leading platform for viewing and sharing content. Analyzing information from YouTube can provide valuable insights into audience preferences and content performance. This project is aimed at investigating different aspects of comments on YouTube videos, as well as various metrics related to these videos, to understand what kind of content should be produced and how to attract viewers.

## Objectives
- **Sentiment Analysis (SA)**: Measure how viewers feel about specific content.
- **Word-Cloud Analysis (WCA)**: Visualize text data to understand common topics discussed in online communities.
- **Emoji Analysis (EA)**: Examine the relevance and context of emoji usage in viewer interactions.
- **Data Integration**: Combine information from different local data sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify categories of videos with the highest likes and investigate various audience engagement metrics.
- **Trend Analysis**: Highlight channels with the highest number of trending videos and analyze the impact of features like punctuation in titles or tags on views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

## Data Handling
- Load and preprocess CSV data files into a manageable format.
- Clean and analyze the data to ensure accurate insights.
- Export cleaned and analyzed data into formats such as CSV, JSON, or database files for accessibility and reusability.

## Key Findings
- Analysis of sentiment in comments to gauge viewer emotions.
- Visualization of common discussion topics through word clouds.
- Insights into the significance of emojis in viewer interactions.
- Identification of video categories with high engagement metrics.
- Examination of how specific features affect video performance metrics.
